COP 5556 - Programming Language Principles

Project2 : RPAL Interpreter

Name: Sachin Edlabadkar

1. The project can be compiled using:

	$ make 
	- An executable is generated in the same folder by the name of p2

2. Usage: ./p2 [-l] [-ast] [-st] filename

	-l listing of input
	-ast  generates abstract syntax tree
	
	-st generates standardized tree.
		
	-order of options is not important 

	NOTE: output is generated only when the program is called with NO SWITCHES. 
	
	To see the output use: ./p2 filename

3. difftest.pl script was able to match the ast generated by this parser to those generated by the original rpal interpreter for all files under the test folder. However, the output matches for all but 2 tests cases, namely, tiny and tiny.1
